# PowerBI-projects

The course project presented an exciting challenge â€“ stepping into the shoes of a Business Intelligence Analyst for AdventureWorks Cycles, a fictional manufacturing company. My mission was to convert raw data into professional-quality reports and dashboards, focusing on tracking KPIs, analyzing product-level trends, and identifying high-value customers.

The hands-on project and real-world assignments allowed me to apply what I learned and build practical expertise along the way.

Here's an overview of the key stages covered in the course:

## Stage 1: 
Connecting & Shaping Data
In this stage, I learned to build automated workflows using Power Query to extract, transform, and load project data. The course covered a range of topics, including data connectors, storage modes, table transformations, and more. I also explored techniques to extract data from web sources and performed data quality assurance using profiling tools.

Stage 2: Creating a Relational Data Model

Stage 2 focused on data modeling best practices, where I was introduced to cardinality, normalization, star schemas, and more. By building the AdventureWorks data model from scratch, I gained a deeper understanding of primary and foreign keys, relationship cardinality, and the importance of filter context in shaping the model.

Stage 3: Adding Calculated Fields with DAX
In this stage, I dived into data analysis expressions (DAX) and learned to create calculated columns and measures. Understanding row and filter context became crucial in applying powerful DAX tools like iterators, filter functions, and time intelligence patterns. This stage elevated my analytical capabilities and enriched my data analysis toolkit.

Stage 4: Visualizing Data with Reports
Stage 4 brought our data to life through captivating reports and interactive dashboards. I explored data visualization best practices and learned to create various charts, implement conditional formatting, and add interactivity with slicers and bookmarks. The course also introduced advanced features like decomposition trees and AI-powered tools for more insightful data exploration.

The course concluded with valuable insights on performance optimization and publishing reports to Power BI Service, ensuring my work remains scalable and accessible to stakeholders.

In summary, this Power BI Desktop course has been a game-changer for my data analysis journey. I am now confident in transforming data into impactful insights and presenting them effectively through stunning visualizations.
